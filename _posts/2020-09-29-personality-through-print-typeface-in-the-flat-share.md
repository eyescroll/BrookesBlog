Beth O'Leary's *The Flat Share*, the bestselling romantic comedy, is a book of two faces. The exuberant and optimistic Tiffy contrasting against pragmatic and candid Leon in narrative voice and writing style to give two distinct protagonists with distinct personalities. This disparity debouches from within the story on the page to the typefaces on the cover.

The cover of the first-edition hardback (as seen above) features four different typefaces- the gold writing, the tagline and reviews, and the two in the title. Each one has a different purpose and voice to it, yet the most important are undoubtedly those in the title of the novel.

Most important of the four texts are those used in the title, as these are the ones that are emblematic of the protagonists of the story. *The Flat* is a lightly-flourished, serifed cursive with the impression of movement to it, and a more handwritten feel for a more personal touch. This is Tiffy, her flamboyance and desire to progress in her life and move away from the circumstances that placed her in the flatshare. In addition, the varied width not only provides an almost-calligraphic feel for her more artistic nature, but also shows how she waivers in the book as she realises certain things that shake her. Leon is the *Share* section of the title. His blunter sans-serif is supportive within itself as a word even as it falters, yet remains more stable than Tiffy's. The rounded nature of certain corners of the letters shows his softening and gentler nature, despite the gruff abrupt nature of his narrative voice. 

Cover designers likely deliberately created the uneven split of the type to show how Tiffy gradually influences Leon and changes his life- beginning by covering the flat in her belongings upon arrival, just as she takes over the title. Meanwhile his placement at the bottom shows the strong foundation he provided for her to come to terms with issues pre-existing the novel and allowing her to grow.
