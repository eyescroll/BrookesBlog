Beth O'Leary's *The Flatshare*, the bestselling romantic comedy, is a book of two faces. The exuberant and optimistic Tiffy contrasting against pragmatic and candid Leon in narrative voice and writing style to give two distinct protagonists with distinct personalities. This disparity debouches from within the story on the page to the typefaces on the cover.

The cover of the first-edition hardback (as seen above) features four different typefaces- the gold writing, the tagline and reviews, and the two in the title. Each one has a different purpose and voice to it, yet the most important are undoubtedly those in the title of the novel.

Most important of the four texts are those used in the title, as these are the ones that are emblematic of the protagonists of the story. *The Flat* is a lightly-flourished, serifed cursive with the impression of movement to it, and a more handwritten feel for a more personal touch. This is Tiffy, her flamboyance and desire to progress in her life and move away from the circumstances that placed her in the flatshare. Leon is the *SHARE* section of the title. His blunter sans-serif is supportive within itself as a word even as it falters, yet remains more stable than Tiffy's. With capitalisation on every letter as well, Leon's *SHARE* is still quite straightforward in a way that lends itself to his shortened, to-the-point narration. Yet in contrast to this gruff, abrupt nature of his "voice", the rounded nature of certain corners of the letters shows his softening and gentler nature indicated both in his interactions with Holly and Mr Prior at work, as well as with Tiffy and his phone conversations with his brother Richie. 

However, the two fonts are drawn together (as the characters themselves are) by two things. Firstly is the fact that, as shown in the cover art, the two are literally in bed together due to their unorthodox rental agreement. The second is, surprisingly, the varied line weight in the words. Tiffy's provides an almost-calligraphic edge to her font as she perseveres and the "pen" flows. In comparison, Leon's typeface features thinner crossbars in almost all his letters, perhaps also an indication of emotional fluctuations during the books where he shifts from his standard mindset of "Just keep it together". Or else these narrower lines could also be where he has been worn down by his responsibilities to brother Richie, girlfriend Kay, and his "Mam".



Cover designers likely deliberately created the uneven split of the type to show how Tiffy gradually influences Leon and changes his life- beginning by covering the flat in her belongings upon arrival, just as she takes over the title. Meanwhile his placement at the bottom shows the strong foundation he provided for her to come to terms with issues pre-existing the novel and allowing her to grow.
