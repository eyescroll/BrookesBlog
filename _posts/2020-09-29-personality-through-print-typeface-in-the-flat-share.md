Beth O'Leary's *The Flat Share*, the bestselling romantic comedy, is a book of two faces. The exuberant and optimistic Tiffy contrasting against pragmatic and candid Leon in narrative voice and writing style to give two distinct protagonists with distinct personalities. This disparity debouches from within the story on the page to the typefaces on the cover.
