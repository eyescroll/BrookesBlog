Kindle, as the majority of people know, is a tablet reading device created to enable the reading of Amazon's eBooks (or Kindle books). In order to allow these to be read with ease for a range of customers, Kindle devices and apps have a small range of typefaces to allow readers to choose the one they prefer. But what are these fonts, and why have they chosen them?



Based on the iPhone app and Kindle Fire 7, there are ten typefaces:

1. Amazon Ember Bold

2. Baskerville

3. Bookerly

4. Caecilia

5. Georgia

6. Helvetica

7. Helvetic Light

8.  Lucidia

9.  OpenDyslexic

10. Palatino
