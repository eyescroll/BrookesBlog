Kindle can refer to several things, including to begin lighting a fire, the Amazon e-readers, and the Amazon eBooks designed for the afore-mentioned devices. The focus here will be the final meaning; the MOBI file digital editions of books. In order to allow these to be read with ease for a range of customers, Kindle devices and apps have a small range of typefaces to allow readers to choose the one they prefer. But what are these fonts, and why have they chosen them?

Based on the most recent iPhone app and Kindle Fire 7, there are ten typefaces:

Those above are the default typefaces available (although there are instructions available online on how to download others for use if the reader desires a specific alternative).

Each typeface has a clear and distinct "voice", yet most only vary in a limited capacity. All are semi-rounded, non-cursive and lack the sloped aspect of italics. Every one is incredibly legible with easily distinguishable letters for ease of reading in order to allow customers the simplicity of content access without questioning the spelling of the words and ruining the flow of the story.

A combination of letter shaping, line thickness, and serif placement differentiates these typefaces. For example, Georgia and Baskerville are quite similar on casual sighting. Yet there are differences when looked at more closely. A focus on the lowercase 'e's exemplifies these. The counters (holes in the letters) are different vertical depths; the inner curve of the left edge is smooth on Georgia but straight on Baskerville; the horizontal part of the 'r' is more elongated on Baskerville; and the more compact nature of Baskerville's height overall. Minute details that differentiate between the two typefaces in a manner that is discernible without being overt.

A interesting, but not entirely unexpected, addition is the Amazon Ember- the brand’s own typeface. This sans-serif design is a way to reassert the identity of the company in its product. It more resembles the utilitarian versatility and approachability of Helvetica than the more literary Bookerly, thanks to the intent of the typographers in both cases. Helvetica was inspired by the minimalism of the fifties to help simplify type, and Amazon Ember was intended to be a recognisable and customer-oriented typeface for the company with a smile logo. To include this typeface in Kindle apps and devices is simply a way to remind users the source of their content- like how books typically have the title in the “header” of a page.

The outlier of the group is, obviously, the Open Dyslexic typeface. This is an open-source typeface made publicly available and weighted alternatively on different letters to help distinguish them*. It allows a more side-lined group of content consumers to read their purchases more easily.

Yet regardless of which typeface the content consumer chooses, the important thing is this: that reading material is as widely available as can be facilitated in order to assist as many people who wish to learn and enjoy the resources.
