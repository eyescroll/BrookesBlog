A word can have a number of meanings and interpretations, especially when written. One way to indicate tone is through the typeface and font, which is incredibly common in most forms of media. Yet simply because it *can* indicate tone, does this mean it *should*?

It is easy to say yes. The subconscious effect of typeface typeface has been well documented (simply type "TED typography" into YouTube for examples) and is a major aspect of study in typography. Why should writers and designers and marketers waste such a valuable and easily accessible tool when it has proven so effective? A serif for class, size for emphasis and to draw focus, cursive/script/handwritten styles for a more personal touch, novelty to depict genre or origin; even a minor change in design can shake the word to its core. To its very meaning. Such a fundamental impact, it can be argued, would make it an irresponsibility or even negligence on the part of the creators to ignore this.

And yet, to rely too heavily on typography to convey tone and meaning could also be considered lazy or overkill. Part of the reason certain fonts, such as the infamous Helvetica, became so popular was their monotone and ubiquity. Their simplicity allowed them to stand out from the "shouting" of specialised fonts. This divergence into less decorative typefaces proved a huge success in several cases (Gill Sans and the Johnston typeface, for example, were the key factors in rebranding the railway systems of England and gained widespread popularity despite having little relation to the words themselves). It can be argued that the more "basic" types stand out due to their distinction from the noise of specialised fonts. Even typographers recommend limited use of novelty fonts and often banish them to outskirts altogether in favour of legibility. At what point does a typeface go from conveying the desired tone, to being overkill and excessive or even overlabouring the point? And why run that risk at all if a simpler, less specialised font would suit that word just as easily as a more decorative one?



Sometimes, however, typeface is essential to the message of a word. Certain brands rely on their font as part of their identity; others need typeface to appeal to their core market in competitive areas; more still are dependent on it for emphasis where every inch of space and detail is at a premium.
