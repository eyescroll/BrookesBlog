For those (hopefully few) who are unaware, The Big Issue is a charity attempting to assist the homeless by helping foster an income- the sale of their weekly magazines for Â£3 per copy. The organisation has been running for nearly thirty years, and work hard to make it clear their goal is to be "A Hand Up, Not A Handout".
