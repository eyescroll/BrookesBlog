What do these three novels have in common? All three were written by female authors. All three have been on award shortlists. All three are dystopian novels focusing on a dramatically different to our society, thanks to a skew in the scales of gender power. Yet the plots are incredibly different, the authors of different ages and intents. So why are the three so reminiscent of one another?

The three are have "similar" paratextual elements in some regards. In these editions, all have a bold and vivid red colour prominent on them. All focus on the title as a, or even *the*, major element of the cover's layout. This could have two reasons. The first is that for each of these books, the title is the focus of the plot. Atwood's *The Handmaid's Tale* is, according to the "epilogue", the transcription of the recorded musings of an escaped Handmaid from Gilead, an extreme and violent patriarchy. Alderman's *The Power* questions what would happen if women suddenly gained a physical advantage over men, and how would this change society? And *Vox* by Daschler follows the story of a woman in a country where women are silenced by law. All three have titles that encapsulate the focus of the book.
