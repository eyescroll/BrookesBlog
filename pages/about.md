The title of this blog is something known and done by any number of book enthusiasts. Marginalia are the annotations and notes made by readers in the margins of the texts, and have a long tradition from scholars and scribes alike. Both academic and humorous images and comments were included. So the name of this blog is an homage to long-ago readers and writers.



This is a media blog, focusing mainly on book-associated commentaries. These are varied from reviews and commentaries, to paratextual/contextual analysis.
